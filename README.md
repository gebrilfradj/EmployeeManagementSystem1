# EmployeeManagementSystem1
Welcome To My Employee/Intern management system. I created this during off/free time during my internship at ups to give my supervisor a way to keep track of all new interns that will come in and out during the next few years. As of now it is still in development, but by the end of the internship I would like to have given this to my supervisor and even aiding in deployment. 


Instructions:

Technical Details: The main code for the frontend UI has been done in HTML/CSS and the backend was done using JavaScript and the OpenAI API which allows for the implementation of the chatbot. Using specific libraries and resources such as the API and Cors, the backend runs so that it sends requests to the AI and responses it gets are then seen on screen. Downloaded additional packs such as bcrypt, cors, express, node, and mongodb.

Login and Access Credentials for APIs: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-projfbnqC6MFfvhpPfkCKG1FT3BlbkFJfTM8qZ2rU4oSWDvFtVrx MONGODB_URI = 'mongodb+srv://user2000:test234@cluster0.bnjolls.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0';

Installation Instructions: To view or use the BuddySupport website, currently there is a local way to view the website. Simple download all the files, use the NodeJS package on the computer to run the server files. This will get the server online on local host 3000, and then running the live server for chatbot.html will put it online on port 5501(or 5500 if it is not taken already) and allow users to view this way. Make sure once everything is running to not stay on the live server in your browser and instead look up localhost:5500 or 5501 to get the actual website up instead of the live server. Any updates to the database will be seen in the terminal window and any post requests made by the user to the Openai API will be shown in the terminal too.
