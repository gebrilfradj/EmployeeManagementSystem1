# EmployeeManagementSystem1
Welcome To My Employee/Intern management system. I created this during off/free time during my internship at ups to give my supervisor a way to keep track of all new interns that will come in and out during the next few years. As of now it is still in development, but by the end of the internship I would like to have given this to my supervisor and even aiding in deployment.
